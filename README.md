### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Shreya 
As a motivated third-year engineering student, I am eager to utilize my skills in creating efficient and adaptable solutions. My experience with 2-D LiDAR autonomous navigation and dynamic motion planning has equipped me with the necessary technical skills to contribute to challenging projects. Currently, I am involved in developing a level 3 autonomy underwater vehicle for the TAC 2023 challenge. I am keen to delve deeper into the field of machine learning and deep learning algorithms that can be integrated with robotic system frameworks. My ultimate goal is to develop innovative and practical solutions that can make a significant impact. I am actively seeking new development opportunities to achieve this objective.

### Hi there 👋
Second-year master’s student in Robotic Systems Development at Carnegie Mellon University. My work focuses on computer vision, 3D perception, and learning-based methods for robotics. 

I have experience with multi-view 3D reconstruction, instance segmentation in sparse point clouds, autonomous navigation using a 2D LiDAR, and constrained motion planning for multi-arm manipulation systems. I build and deploy deep learning models for robotic perception, integrating classic vision algorithms with neural networks on edge devices. Skilled in Python, C++, PyTorch3D, OpenCV, ROS2, and deploying solutions in real-world and simulated environments. 

Seeking roles in vision, perception, and learning for robotics and intelligent systems.
